	<h1> Some boring and trivial Personal information</h1>
	<p>Well, I think there are nothing too much I want to say about myself.
	   I’m Yifei Sun, an international student from Shanghai China.
	   I’m currently a senior in business analytics field. This is actually my fifth year studying in America. I spent my final year of high school in Kansas city.> 
	   Although I have one extra year of English-learning environment, my English is still terrible, so please forgive me if I say anything stupid or use some awkward words.</p4>
	   I really appreciate your understanding. Thank you!</p>
	<p2> My family members always say I’m a stone-like boy. Well, this statement might sound like a little mean, but in my perspectives, it’s pretty accurate to describe my personalities. I’m an obedient person. I never went to bars or pubs or do anything that a young, rigorous juvenile should try. I like to follow the rules, I like the feeling that everything is done based on right procedure, everything is carried out with the correct methods. My friends always say that there is a fifty-year-old soul accidentally stuck in a twenty—year-old body ~. I like to share the most genuine myself to everyone. Unlike many ambitious students, I’m practical and traditional. I evaluate family as the most important part of my life. A decent salary and a chance to fulfill my filial responsibility is enough to me. Well, after talking about so many serious things, let me tell you why I’m a good stone~. I’m diligent to my work. I might not be a good leader, but I must be a solid team member. I’m plain and honest to other people. If you are considering making new friend, I might be a good choice XD. Anyway, in the end, thanks all of you guys for spending time to get to know me.</p2>
